An alternative to Twitter's verified program powered by [Keybase](https://keybase.io).

Proven is a browser extension that adds badges like for keybase, github, etc
next to users names like Twitter's verified badge but based what accounts the
user has posted proofs for Keybase. See the screenshot for what it looks like.

In addition to twitter, it adds badges on Hacker News too.
